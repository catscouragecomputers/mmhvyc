## Brainstorm
- Software system that analyzes open-source software metrics based on
    - How well collaboration is working on project
    - Health of the project for customers and streamlining business/engineer communication

### Requirements
- The metrics should be tracked with automated updates.
- Notifications should be relayed to people working on the project.
- Investors
    - Investors need a UI to see data visualized simply
- Developers
    - Devs would need access to a database to store metrics data
- Users
    - Users should be able to implement the API into any part of the system
    - Users want better visualizations of metrics
        - System needs multiple user endpoints (API) to access specific metrics for what is important to respective roles
    - Users need version control implemented to track timestamps of commits, issues, pull requests, etc.

- things to track
    - rate of commits
    - volume of commits
    - time between
    - amount of people working on branches
    - track code re-use
